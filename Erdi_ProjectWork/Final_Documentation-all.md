##Introduction

The purpose of this document is to explain the methods in the Serializer, in order to have a better understanding of how HtmSerializer works.

## The code is an example of custom serialization, it's a class called HtmSerializer which contains several methods that handle the serialization and deserialization of different types. The methods include:

## SerializeBegin(string typeName, StreamWriter sw) - This method is used to write the start marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected parameter:

typeName: a string that represents the type name.
sw: a StreamWriter object that is used to write a string to a stream.

The expected output:none.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L50

===

## ReadBegin(string typeName) - This method reads the start marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected parameter:

typeName: a string that represents the type name.

The expected output:

A string that consists of a type delimiter, the word "BEGIN", the type name in single quotes, and another type delimiter.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L60

===

##  public static void Reset() This code is defining a static method "Reset" in a class. The method has three operations:

It clears the contents of a dictionary "SerializedHashCodes".

It clears the contents of another dictionary "MapObjectHashCode".

It sets the static field "Id" to 0.

It doesn't take any input.

The expected output : None

Example:  https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L66

===

## public static void Save(string fileName, object obj)

The function "Save" is a public static method in some program.

The input for this function consists of two parameters:

"fileName": a string that specifies the name of the file to be saved.
"obj": an object that needs to be saved.

The function performs the following operations:

Calls the "Reset" method to reset the collections and variable.
Creates a StreamWriter object using the "fileName" parameter as the file name.
Calls the "Serialize" method with the "obj" parameter and a null value, and the created StreamWriter object as arguments.

The expected output : None

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L73

===

## public static T Load<T>(string fileName)

The function "Load" is a public "static" method in some program.

The input for this function is a single parameter:

"fileName": a string that specifies the name of the file to be loaded.

The function performs the following operations:

Calls the "Reset" method to reset the collections and variable.
Creates a StreamReader object using the "fileName" parameter as the file name.
Calls the "Deserialize" method with the created StreamReader object as an argument and returns the result.

The function returns an object of the generic type "T", which is specified as a type parameter when calling the function.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L82

===

## public static bool TryLoad<T>(string fileName, out T obj)

The function "TryLoad" is a public static method in some program.

The expected inputs:

"fileName": a string that specifies the name of the file to be loaded.

"obj": an output parameter of type "T", which is a generic type specified when calling the function.

The function performs the following operations:

Checks if the file specified by the "fileName" parameter exists using the "File.Exists" method.
If the file doesn't exist, sets the "obj" parameter to its default value and returns "false".
If the file exists, calls the "Load" method with the "fileName" parameter and assigns the result to the "obj" parameter.
Returns "true".

The function returns a "bool" value indicating whether the file was successfully loaded or not.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L91

===

## SerializeEnd(string typeName, StreamWriter sw) - This method writes the end marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected input:

"typeName": a string that represents the name of a type.

"sw": a StreamWriter object that represents the output stream where the data is to be written.

The function performs the following operation:

Writes an empty line to the StreamWriter object.

Writes a string in the format of "{TypeDelimiter} END '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}" to the StreamWriter object, where "TypeDelimiter" is a constant string in the program and "typeName" is the input parameter.

Writes another empty line to the StreamWriter object.

The expected output: None

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L108

===

## ReadEnd(string typeName) - This method reads the end marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected input:

a single input argument typeName of type 'String'.

The expected output:

a 'String' value that is constructed by concatenating the value of the 'TypeDelimiter' constant, the string " END '", 'typeName' (the input argument), the string "' " and the value of the 'TypeDelimiter' constant again.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L114

===

## SerializeValue(int val, StreamWriter sw) - This method writes the value of an integer type property.

The expected input:

an integer value "val" and a StreamWriter object "sw"

The expected output: none.  

but it writes the following to the stream associated with the "sw" StreamWriter object: A ValueDelimiter string
The string representation of the "val" integer, obtained by calling "val.ToString()"
Another ValueDelimiter string A ParameterDelimiter string.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L125

===

## SerializeKeyValuePair(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw)

The function serializes an object of a generic type that represents a Key-Value pair (e.g. KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>) by extracting the key and value properties of the object, and serializing each of them separately.

It does this by:

Getting the type of the object being serialized and extracting the generic argument types (keyType and valueType).

Finding the key and value fields of the object using the GetFields method, which is presumably a helper method that returns an array of fields for a given type.

Serializing the key and value fields using the Serialize method, which is presumably another helper method.

The expected inputs: an object of a generic type that represents a Key-Value pair, along with a 'StreamWriter' instance to write the serialized data to.

ame: a string that represents the name of the object being serialized.

obj: an object to be serialized.

sw: a StreamWriter instance that will be used to write the serialized data to a stream.

The expected output: none 

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L137

===

## Serialize1(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, Dictionary<Type, Action<StreamWriter, string, object>> customSerializers = null)

The function 'Serialize1' is a serialization function that takes an 'object' as input along with its 'name' and a 'StreamWriter' instance, 'sw',
and an optional 'Dictionary<Type, Action<StreamWriter, string, object>>' for custom serialization of objects of specific types.

The function starts by checking if the input 'obj' is null and returns immediately if that's the case. Otherwise, it retrieves the 'type' of the input 'obj'.

Then, it calls 'SerializeBegin' with 'name' and 'sw' as parameters to serialize the beginning of the object.

Next, it performs type checking for 'obj' and serializes it based on its type. If the type is a primitive type or a 'string', it calls 'SerializeValue' with 'name', 'obj', and 'sw'
as parameters to serialize the value. If the type is a dictionary, it calls 'SerializeDictionary' with 'name', 'obj', and 'sw' as parameters.

If it's a list, it calls 'SerializeIEnumerable' with 'name', 'obj', and 'sw' as parameters. If the type is a class or value type and there's a custom serializer in the 'customSerializers'
dictionary for this type, it calls the corresponding action with 'sw', 'name', and 'obj' as parameters.

Finally, it calls 'SerializeEnd' with 'name' and 'sw' as parameters to serialize the end of the object.

The expected input:

obj: the object to be serialized.

name: the name of the object.

sw: a StreamWriter instance to write the serialized data to.
customSerializers (optional): a dictionary containing custom serializers for specific types.

The expected output: none

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L157

===

## SerializeDictionary(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

The function operates as follows:

It first checks if the type of the obj is a generic type.
If the type is generic, it retrieves the key and value types of the dictionary.
If the key type is not of type string, the function does nothing.
The function then casts the obj to an IEnumerable type and loops through each item in the enumerable.
For each item, it retrieves its properties and serializes each property using the Serialize function.
The Serialize function takes the property value, name, StreamWriter, type, and a list of members to ignore as parameters.

The expected inputs:

name: a string that represents the name of the dictionary object.

obj: an object of any type that needs to be serialized.

sw: a StreamWriter object that writes characters to a stream.
ignoreMembers: an optional parameter of type List<string> that contains members to ignore during serialization.

The expected output: none.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L212

===

## SerializeBegin(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type)

The function writes the serialized representation of the beginning of a property to a stream and operates as follows:

It creates a list of strings listString with the value "Begin".
If the propName is not null or empty, it adds the propName to the listString.
If the type parameter is not null, it adds the full name of the type (without spaces) to the listString.
The function then writes the joined elements of the listString to the StreamWriter object, separated by a space character.

The expected parameters:

propName: a string that represents the name of a property.

sw: a StreamWriter object that writes characters to a stream.

type: an optional parameter of type Type that represents the type of the property.

The expected output:none.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L241

===

## SerializeEnd(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type)

The expected parameters:

propName: a string representing the property name.

sw: a StreamWriter object.

type: a Type object.

The function operates as follows:

Writes a new line to the StreamWriter object sw.
Creates a list of strings listString and adds the string "End" to it.
If propName is not null or empty, it adds propName to listString.
If type is not null, it adds the full name of type to listString after removing spaces.
Writes the joined string of listString to the StreamWriter object sw.

The expected output:none.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L257

===

## private static string ReadGenericBegin(string propName, Type type = null)

The expected parameters:

propName: a string representing the property name.

type: a Type object (with a default value of null).

The expected output:

Creates a list of strings listString and adds the string "Begin" to it.
If propName is not null or empty, it adds propName to listString.
If type is not null, it adds the full name of type to listString after removing spaces.
Returns the joined string of listString.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L274

===

## private static string ReadGenericEnd(string propName, Type type = null)

The purpose of the method is to construct a string that represents the end of a generic object or collection.
The returned string is built by concatenating a list of strings, including "End", the value of "propName" (if it is not null or empty), and the full name of the type of the generic object (if "type" parameter is not null).

The expected parameters:

propName (optional): A string that represents the property name of the generic object or collection.

type (optional): A Type object that represents the type of the generic object or collection.

The expected output: a string that represents the end of a generic object or collection.
The string is constructed by joining the list of strings with a space separator using the String.Join() method.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L289

===

## SerializeValue(string propertyName, object val, StreamWriter sw)

The method operates as follows:

The ToString() method is called on the val object to get its string representation.
If val is of type string, then any line breaks within the string are replaced with the string "\n".
Finally, the resulting string is written to the StreamWriter object sw using the Write method.

The expected parameter:

propertyName: a string representing the name of a property

val: an object that needs to be serialized into a string

sw: a StreamWriter object, which is a type of stream that can be used to write text data to a file or other data stream.

The expected output:none.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L305

===

## SerializeIEnumerable(string propertyName, object obj, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

The function 'SerializeIEnumerable' is a method that serializes an object that implements the IEnumerable interface into a string representation and
writes it to a StreamWriter object.

The method operates as follows:

The type of the obj object is checked to determine if it is a multidimensional array or a collection of items.

If it is a multidimensional array, the method calls SerializeMultidimensionalArray to serialize the array.

If it is a collection of integers, the method creates a comma-separated string from the items and calls Serialize with the string and a property name of "ArrayContent".

If it is a collection of objects, the method iterates over the items and calls Serialize on each item, passing in the item,
the property name "CollectionItem", the StreamWriter object, the type of the elements, and the ignoreMembers list.

The expected output:none.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L319

===

## IsMultiDimensionalArray(object obj)

This is a private static method in C# that checks if a given object is a multidimensional array.

Operation: The method takes an object type input and casts it to an Array type.
 If the cast is successful and the Rank property of the array is greater than 1, it returns true because it is a multidimensional array.
If the cast is not successful or the Rank is 1 or less, it returns false.

The expected parameter: an object type.

The expected output: a bool type and is true if the input obj is a multidimensional array, and false otherwise.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L360

===

## SerializeMultidimensionalArray(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)

Operation: it writes the serialized representation of the multi-dimensional array to the StreamWriter object.
The serialization process includes writing the rank of the array, the dimensions, the default value of the elements,
and the elements with non-default values along with their indexes.
The serialization is done using calls to other functions like SerializeBegin, SerializeValue, Serialize, and SerializeEnd.

The expected parameter:

obj: an object which should be a multi-dimensional array.

name: a string representing the name of the array.

sw: a StreamWriter object that is used to write the serialized output.

The expected output:none.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L370

===

Loops through each dimension of the input array array and adds its length to the dimensions list.
Reverses the dimensions list and stores it in reversedDims.
Calculates the total number of elements in the input array array and stores it in totalElement.
Loops through each element in the range of 0 to totalElement - 1.
Calculates the indexes of the current element by dividing the current index by each dimension length in reversedDims, storing the remainder in the indexes list.
Adds the current indexes list to result as a comma-separated string.
Returns the result list.

The expected parameter: a multi-dimensional array of any size and data type

The expected output: a list of strings that contains the index of each element of the input array as a comma-separated string.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L427

===

## private static int[] GetIndexesFromFlatIndex(int flatIndex, List<int> dimensions)

The method operates as follows:

Initializes an empty list of integers result.
Reverses the dimensions list and stores it in reversedDims.
Initializes a variable curVal with the value of the input flatIndex.
Loops through each dimension length in reversedDims.
Calculates the index of the current element by getting the remainder of curVal divided by the current dimension length, and inserts it at the beginning of the result list.
Updates the value of curVal by dividing it by the current dimension length.
Returns the result list as an array of integers.

The expected input: an integer flatIndex representing the position of the element in a flattened version of the array,
 and a list of integers dimensions representing the lengths of each dimension of the multi-dimensional array

The expected output: 
an array of integers that contains the index of the element in the multi-dimensional array.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L456

===

## public static object GetDefault(Type type)

The method operates as follows:

Checks if the input type type is a value type by calling the IsValueType method on the type object.
If the input type is a value type, creates a new instance of the type using the Activator.CreateInstance method, and returns it as an object.
If the input type is not a value type, returns null.

The expected input: is a Type object representing a type

The expected output: an object representing the default value of the input type.
If the input type is a value type, the output is an instance of the type. If the input type is not a value type, the output is null.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L469

## public static void SerializeObject(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Serialize method to serialize the properties and fields of a class object. 

The expected input:It takes in the same parameters as the main Serialize method, plus an optional list of members to ignore during serialization. 

The expected output:
It starts by checking if the object passed in is null, and if it is, it returns immediately. 
It then gets the type of the object and creates lists of the object's properties and fields using the GetProperties and GetFields methods.
It then loops through the properties and fields, checking if the current property or field is in the ignore list or if the property can't be written to. 
If either of these conditions are true, it continues to the next property or field. Otherwise, 
it gets the value of the property or field and calls the main Serialize method to serialize it. 
If it throws an exception while trying to read the property or field, it will print a warning message.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L554

 ===
 
## private static List<FieldInfo> GetFields(Type type)

This is a **helper** method called by the SerializeObject method, which is used to get the fields of a specific type. 

The expected input: The method takes in a single parameter, "type", which is the Type of the object for which the fields are to be retrieved.

The expected output: It check if the type has a base type and if it does, it adds all the fields of the base type to the fields list using GetFields method.
It returns the final list of fields, which can be used to iterate through the fields of an object and retrieve their values.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L609

 ===
 
## private static List<PropertyInfo> GetProperties(Type type)

This is a **helper** method called by the SerializeObject method, which is used to get the properties of a specific type. 

The expected input: The method takes in a single parameter, "type", which is the Type of the object for which the properties are to be retrieved.

The expected output: It then returns the list of properties, which can be used to iterate through the properties of an object and retrieve their values.
It is worth noting that the commented code was supposed to get the properties of the base type as well but it is commented out which means that it is not currently used, 
so this method will only retrieve the properties of the current type passed to it and not the base type.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L620

 ===
 
## private static void SerializeDistalDendrite(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Serialize method to serialize a DistalDendrite object. 

The expected input: It takes in the same parameters as the main Serialize method (the object to be serialized, a name for the object, 
and a StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to).
It starts by creating a new list of members to ignore during serialization, which includes the "ParentCell" property of the DistalDendrite object. 
Then it calls the SerializeObject method, passing in the object, the name, the StreamWriter, and the ignore list.
It then gets the ParentCell property of the DistalDendrite object and checks if it has been serialized before by checking if it exists in isCellsSerialized list, 
if not it adds it to the list and call the Serialize method to serialize the ParentCell object, passing in the ParentCell object, the name "ParentCell", the StreamWriter, 
and the ignore list as parameters.
This method is specifically for the DistalDendrite class and it is used to serialize the parent cell object and make sure it is not serialized multiple times.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L631

 ===
 
## private static void SerializeHtmConfig(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Serialize method to serialize a HtmConfig object. 
It takes in the same parameters as the main Serialize method (the object to be serialized, a name for the object, 
and a StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to).
It starts by creating a new list of members to ignore during serialization, which includes the "Random" property of the HtmConfig object. 
Then it calls the SerializeObject method, passing in the object, the name, the StreamWriter, and the ignore list.
It then gets the HtmConfig object and calls the Serialize method to serialize the "Random" property, passing in the RandomGenSeed, 
the name "Random" and the StreamWriter as parameters.
This method is specifically for the HtmConfig class and it is used to exclude the "Random" property from the serialization while still serializing the RandomGenSeed property.
 
Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L645

 ===
 
## private static void SerializeHomeostaticPlasticityController(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Serialize method to serialize a HomeostaticPlasticityController object. 
It takes in the same parameters as the main Serialize method (the object to be serialized, a name for the object, 
and a StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to).
It starts by creating a new list of members to ignore during serialization, 
which includes the "m_OnStabilityStatusChanged" field of the HomeostaticPlasticityController object. 
Then it calls the SerializeObject method, passing in the object, the name, the StreamWriter, and the ignore list.
The method then ends with the region Deserialization, which contains the definition of a Deserialize method but is commented out, 
this method is not currently in use. It's purpose would be to deserialize the object by reading the contents of the StreamReader and returning the deserialized object of the type T.
 
Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L655

 ===
 
## public static T Deserialize<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName = null)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Deserialize method to deserialize an object. It takes in a single parameter, a StreamReader sr, which contains the serialized data, 
and an optional string propName, which is the name of the property being deserialized.
The method starts by defining a default value for the output object and getting the type of the object to be deserialized. 
It then check if the type of the object to be deserialized implements the ISerializable interface, 
if yes it finds the Deserialize method of that type by looking for the method which named Deserialize, is static and has two parameters by using reflection. 
it then calls the method using the invoke method and passing the sr and propName as arguments.
Otherwise, the method checks if the type is a value type, a dictionary, a list, or a KeyValuePair, it calls the corresponding method to deserialize these types.
Otherwise, it calls the DeserializeObject method to deserialize the object and returns the deserialized object of the type T.
It's worth noting that this method is generic and can be used to deserialize any type of object.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L672

 ===
 
## private static T DeserializeKeyValuePair<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Deserialize method to deserialize a KeyValuePair object. 
It takes in the same parameters as the main Deserialize method (a StreamReader sr and an optional string propName).
The method starts by defining default values for the key and value of the KeyValuePair, 
getting the types of the key and the value, and using reflection to get the generic version of the Deserialize method, the ReadGenericBegin method and the ReadGenericEnd method.
Then it reads the content of the StreamReader line by line until the end of the file, and for each line, it checks if it starts with the beginKey or the beginValue, 
it calls the Deserialize method passing the keyType or the valueType as a generic argument, to deserialize the key or the value respectively.
Then it creates the key-value pair object by calling the Activator.CreateInstance method passing the type of the key-value pair, the key and the value as arguments.
It returns the deserialized key-value pair object.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L722

## private static object DeserializeCell(StreamReader sr, string propName)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Deserialize method to deserialize a Cell object. It takes in the same parameters as the main Deserialize method 
(a StreamReader sr and an optional string propName)
The method starts by calling the main Deserialize method with a generic argument of type Cell, passing the StreamReader as an argument. 
This will deserialize the cell object from the StreamReader.
Then it loops through the DistalDendrites of the deserialized cell object, and sets the ParentCell property of each DistalDendrite to the deserialized cell object.
It returns the deserialized cell object with the correct ParentCell properties set for the DistalDendrites.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L787

## private static T DeserializeIEnumerable<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName)

private static T DeserializeIEnumerable<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName)

This is a method that deserializes an object of a generic type T that implements the IEnumerable interface, such as lists or arrays. 
The method first determines the type of the elements in the enumerable by checking if the type is a generic type or an array. 
It then creates an empty list and reads each line of the input stream, checking if it is a valid element of the enumerable. 
If it is, it deserializes the element and adds it to the list. Once all elements have been read, the method converts the list to the appropriate type 
(e.g. array or List<T>) using the Enumerable class's ToArray or ToList methods, and returns the resulting object.
It also handle case when the element is int, it will deserialize the string of array of ints, split it by ',' and convert it back to int. 
It also handles case when the element is multidimensional array.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L798

 ===
 
## private static Array DeserializeMultidimensionalArray(StreamReader sr, string propName, Type arrayType)

This code defines methods for deserializing a C# object from a stream. The Deserialize<T> method is the main method and it is used to deserialize any type of object.
The method checks if the type of the object to be deserialized is a value type, a dictionary, a list, or a KeyValuePair, 
and calls the appropriate helper method to deserialize the object. If the type of the object is not any of the above, it deserializes the object as a regular object.
The DeserializeMultidimensionalArray method is used to deserialize multidimensional arrays. 
It reads the rank of the array and the size of each dimension and creates an array with the specified size and rank.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L870

 ===
 
## private static object CastListToType(List<object> enumerable, Type elementType)


The CastListToType method is used to convert a list of objects to a specific type. It uses the Cast method of the System.Linq.Enumerable class to do the conversion.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L933

 ===  
## private static T DeserializeDictionary<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName)

This method deserialize a dictionary from a stream reader. It starts by creating an instance of the dictionary using the Activator.CreateInstance method. 
It then gets the generic argument types for the keys and values of the dictionary. 
It then sets up some variables and methods that will be used later in the method such as the beginKey, beginValue, beginKeyValuePair, endKeyValuePair, and deserializeMethod.
It enters a while loop that continues until there are no more lines left in the stream reader. It reads a line from the stream and trims it. 
It then checks if the line is the end of the dictionary, if it is empty, or if it is the beginning of a key-value pair. If it is the end of the dictionary or empty, 
the loop continues. If it is the beginning of a key-value pair, the values for key and value are reset to null.
If the line starts with the beginKey, it gets the specified type for the key and deserializes it. If the line starts with the beginValue, 
it gets the specified type for the value and deserializes it. Once both the key and value are not null, it attempts to add the key-value pair to the dictionary using the TryAdd or Add method depending on the type of the dictionary.
 
Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L940

***Some definitions***
###### Helper method
> A helper method is a small, reusable piece of code that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of the program to perform that task. 
Helper methods are often used to encapsulate complex logic or repetitive tasks, making the code that calls them more readable and easier to understand. 
They can also be used to provide a simplified interface to a more complex piece of code. 
Helper methods are commonly used in object-oriented programming and are often defined as private or protected methods within a class, 
so they can only be accessed by the class or its derived classes. They can also be defined as static methods in a separate utility class.

## public static T DeserializeObject<T>(StreamReader sr, string propertyName, List<string> excludeEntries = null, Action<T, string> action = null)

This is a method in C# that deserializes an object of a generic type 'T' from a StreamReader. 

The expected input: The method takes in a StreamReader, a property name, an optional list of fields to exclude during deserialization, and an optional action to perform on fields that are excluded during deserialization.

The method first checks if the type is an interface or abstract and if it is, it returns the default value of the type. It then creates an instance of the type using Activator.CreateInstance, gets the properties and fields of the type, and reads the StreamReader line by line. 
It then checks for specific keywords in the line and performs different actions based on the keyword. If the line starts with "Begin", it checks for specific keywords and deserializes different properties or fields accordingly. 
It also keeps track of the objects deserialized using a hashcode and stores them in a map.

The expected output: An object of type T that has been deserialized from a string representation. 
If the deserialization process is successful, this method should return the deserialized object with its properties and fields set to the values specified in the input string.


Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L1029

## private static object DeserializeHtmConfig(StreamReader sr, string propertyName)

This is a C# method that deserializes an object of type "HtmConfig" from a stream reader. 
   
The method takes two inputs:

A StreamReader object "sr" which is used to read a stream of data, usually a file or network stream. The method reads the data from the stream and deserializes it into an object of type "HtmConfig".

A string "propertyName", which is used as a reference to the property being deserialized. This string is passed along to other methods called within this method such as "DeserializeObject" and "Deserialize".
   
The method creates a new list of strings called "excludeEntries" which contains the name of the property "Random" and uses it to exclude it from the deserialization process.
The method then creates a new instance of "ThreadSafeRandom" using the seed and assigns it to the "Random" property of the "HtmConfig" object.
Finally, the method returns the deserialized "HtmConfig" object.
Additionally, the method relies on other methods such as "DeserializeObject" and "Deserialize", which are necessary to understand the full functionality of this method.

Expected output: This method doesn't have any expected output since it returns an object of type object and its behavior depends on the implementation details of the methods called within it.


Example:  https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L1174

===

##  private static T DeserializeValue<T>(StreamReader sr, string propertyName)

The expected input: The input of this code is a StreamReader "sr" and a string "propertyName". The StreamReader reads the content from a stream and the string "propertyName" is the name of the property being deserialized.
    
This method appears to be deserializing a single value of a specified generic type "T" from a StreamReader (the StreamReader "sr" and the contents of the stream it is reading from).
The method reads lines from the StreamReader until it reaches a line that matches the end marker for the property, and uses the Convert.ChangeType method to convert each line read to the specified type "T" before returning the final converted value.
A special case is made for strings, where newline characters "\n" are replaced with actual newlines "\n" before being casted to the type T.
As well as the implementation of the "ReadGenericEnd" and "ReadGenericBegin" methods used within the method. 
	
The expected output: Depend on the specific type of the generic parameter "T" that is passed to the method.

Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L1190

===

##  public void SerializeValue(object val, Type type, StreamWriter sw)

This code is a method that serializes an object to a text stream using a StreamWriter.

The expected input: the object to be serialized, the type of the object, and the StreamWriter to write the serialized object to.
    
The method first checks if the object is a value type (such as an int or a struct) using the IsValueType property.
If it is a value type, it writes the value of the object to the StreamWriter surrounded by a delimiter.
If it is not a value type, it looks for a method called "Serialize" on the object's type and invokes it, passing in the StreamWriter as a parameter.
If no such method is found, it throws a NotSupportedException.

The expected output: Serialization of the input object in the form of text written to the input StreamWriter.
It does not return anything, it just writes the serialized form of the object to the StreamWriter.
	
Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L1255

===

## public T DeserializeValue<T>(StreamReader sr)

This method is a generic method that deserializes a value of type T from a StreamReader.

The expected input: StreamReader and the value of the ParameterDelimiter.
   
If T is a value type, the method reads a line from the StreamReader, trims it, and replaces a specified delimiter with an empty string.
Then it converts the string to the type T and returns it.
If T is not a value type, the method uses reflection to look for a method called "Deserialize" on the type T, and if it exists, it invokes that method and returns the result.
If the "Deserialize" method does not exist, it throws a NotSupportedException.

The expected output: We need StreamReader and the value of the ParameterDelimiter for output.
   
Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L1276

===

## public Synapse DeserializeSynapse(StreamReader sr)

This code is deserializing a Synapse object from a text file using a StreamReader.

The expected input: StreamReader object that is connected to a text file. 
  
The text file should contain serialized information about a Synapse object in a specific format that is understood by the "Deserialize" method of the Synapse class and the "ReadBegin" method. 
It reads lines of data from the file until it reaches a line that matches the string returned by the "ReadBegin" method with the parameter "nameof(Synapse)".
It then calls the "Deserialize" method on the Synapse class, passing in the StreamReader.

The expected output: instance of the Synapse class that has been deserialized from a text file using a StreamReader. 
If it could not find the string returned by "ReadBegin" method with the parameter "nameof(Synapse)", it would return null.
	
Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L1322

===

## public DistalDendrite DeserializeDistalDendrite(StreamReader sr)

The expected input: StreamReader object, which is passed as an argument to the method. 

The StreamReader object is used to read the data that is used to deserialize the DistalDendrite object. 
This is a method in C# that deserializes a DistalDendrite object from a StreamReader object. 
The method reads lines of data from the StreamReader and checks if the line of data is the start of a DistalDendrite object. 
If it is, it creates a DistalDendrite object using the  DistalDendrite.
Deserialize method and sets its ParentCell property.
   
The expected output: DistalDendrite object if the marker is found in the stream otherwise it will return null.
   
Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L1353
 
 ===
 
 ## public void SerializeValue(double val, StreamWriter sw)
 
This is a method that serializes a double value to a StreamWriter.

The expected input: Starts by writing a ValueDelimiter to the StreamWriter, then it formats the double value using the CultureInfo.InvariantCulture and a format of "0.000" and writes it to the StreamWriter. 
   
After that, it writes another ValueDelimiter and a ParameterDelimiter to the StreamWriter. This method is likely used to write double values to a file or other stream in a specific format.
The output of this code would be the double value passed as an argument to the method, formatted as a string with three decimal places, preceded by a ValueDelimiter and followed by a ValueDelimiter and a ParameterDelimiter. 
For example, if the method is called with the value of 1.234, the output written to the StreamWriter would be something like this: "|1.234|,".

The expected output: It is important to note that the method does not return any output, it writes the output to the StreamWriter passed as argument.
   
Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L1382
