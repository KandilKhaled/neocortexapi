===

# SerializeKeyValuePair(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw)

The function serializes an object of a generic type that represents a Key-Value pair (e.g. KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>) by extracting the key and value properties of the object, and serializing each of them separately.

It does this by:

Getting the type of the object being serialized and extracting the generic argument types (keyType and valueType).
Finding the key and value fields of the object using the GetFields method, which is presumably a helper method that returns an array of fields for a given type.
Serializing the key and value fields using the Serialize method, which is presumably another helper method.

The expected parameters to this function is: an object of a generic type that represents a Key-Value pair, along with a 'StreamWriter' instance to write the serialized data to.
name: a string that represents the name of the object being serialized.
obj: an object to be serialized.
sw: a StreamWriter instance that will be used to write the serialized data to a stream.

The expected output: none 

-Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L137

# Serialize1(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, Dictionary<Type, Action<StreamWriter, string, object>> customSerializers = null)

The function 'Serialize1' is a serialization function that takes an 'object' as input along with its 'name' and a 'StreamWriter' instance, 'sw',
and an optional 'Dictionary<Type, Action<StreamWriter, string, object>>' for custom serialization of objects of specific types.

The function starts by checking if the input 'obj' is null and returns immediately if that's the case. Otherwise, it retrieves the 'type' of the input 'obj'.
Then, it calls 'SerializeBegin' with 'name' and 'sw' as parameters to serialize the beginning of the object.
Next, it performs type checking for 'obj' and serializes it based on its type. If the type is a primitive type or a 'string', it calls 'SerializeValue' with 'name', 'obj', and 'sw'
as parameters to serialize the value. If the type is a dictionary, it calls 'SerializeDictionary' with 'name', 'obj', and 'sw' as parameters.
If it's a list, it calls 'SerializeIEnumerable' with 'name', 'obj', and 'sw' as parameters. If the type is a class or value type and there's a custom serializer in the 'customSerializers'
dictionary for this type, it calls the corresponding action with 'sw', 'name', and 'obj' as parameters.

Finally, it calls 'SerializeEnd' with 'name' and 'sw' as parameters to serialize the end of the object.

The expected input:
obj: the object to be serialized.
name: the name of the object.
sw: a StreamWriter instance to write the serialized data to.
customSerializers (optional): a dictionary containing custom serializers for specific types.

The expected output: none

-Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L157

===

# SerializeDictionary(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

The function operates as follows:

It first checks if the type of the obj is a generic type.
If the type is generic, it retrieves the key and value types of the dictionary.
If the key type is not of type string, the function does nothing.
The function then casts the obj to an IEnumerable type and loops through each item in the enumerable.
For each item, it retrieves its properties and serializes each property using the Serialize function.
The Serialize function takes the property value, name, StreamWriter, type, and a list of members to ignore as parameters.

The expected parameters:
name: a string that represents the name of the dictionary object.
obj: an object of any type that needs to be serialized.
sw: a StreamWriter object that writes characters to a stream.
ignoreMembers: an optional parameter of type List<string> that contains members to ignore during serialization.

The expected output: none.

-Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L212

===

# SerializeBegin(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type)

The function writes the serialized representation of the beginning of a property to a stream and operates as follows:

It creates a list of strings listString with the value "Begin".
If the propName is not null or empty, it adds the propName to the listString.
If the type parameter is not null, it adds the full name of the type (without spaces) to the listString.
The function then writes the joined elements of the listString to the StreamWriter object, separated by a space character.

The expected parameters:
propName: a string that represents the name of a property.
sw: a StreamWriter object that writes characters to a stream.
type: an optional parameter of type Type that represents the type of the property.

The expected output:none.

-Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L241

===

#SerializeEnd(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type)

The expected parameters:
propName: a string representing the property name.
sw: a StreamWriter object.
type: a Type object.

The function operates as follows:

Writes a new line to the StreamWriter object sw.
Creates a list of strings listString and adds the string "End" to it.
If propName is not null or empty, it adds propName to listString.
If type is not null, it adds the full name of type to listString after removing spaces.
Writes the joined string of listString to the StreamWriter object sw.

The expected output:none.

-Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L257

If type is not null, it adds the full name of type to listString after removing spaces.
Returns the joined string of listString.

-Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L274

===

# private static string ReadGenericEnd(string propName, Type type = null)

The purpose of the method is to construct a string that represents the end of a generic object or collection.
The returned string is built by concatenating a list of strings, including "End", the value of "propName" (if it is not null or empty), and the full name of the type of the generic object (if "type" parameter is not null).

The expected parameters:
propName (optional): A string that represents the property name of the generic object or collection.
type (optional): A Type object that represents the type of the generic object or collection.

The expected output: a string that represents the end of a generic object or collection.
The string is constructed by joining the list of strings with a space separator using the String.Join() method.

-Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L289

===

# SerializeValue(string propertyName, object val, StreamWriter sw)

The method operates as follows:

The ToString() method is called on the val object to get its string representation.
If val is of type string, then any line breaks within the string are replaced with the string "\n".
Finally, the resulting string is written to the StreamWriter object sw using the Write method.

The expected parameter:
propertyName: a string representing the name of a property
val: an object that needs to be serialized into a string
sw: a StreamWriter object, which is a type of stream that can be used to write text data to a file or other data stream.

===

#SerializeIEnumerable(string propertyName, object obj, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

The function 'SerializeIEnumerable' is a method that serializes an object that implements the IEnumerable interface into a string representation and
writes it to a StreamWriter object.

The method operates as follows:

The type of the obj object is checked to determine if it is a multidimensional array or a collection of items.
If it is a multidimensional array, the method calls SerializeMultidimensionalArray to serialize the array.
If it is a collection of integers, the method creates a comma-separated string from the items and calls Serialize with the string and a property name of "ArrayContent".
If it is a collection of objects, the method iterates over the items and calls Serialize on each item, passing in the item,
the property name "CollectionItem", the StreamWriter object, the type of the elements, and the ignoreMembers list.

The expected output:none.

-Example: https://github.com/KandilKhaled/neocortexapi/blob/6ac4ee5f46e9000ad59746b4f008aca920c16254/source/NeoCortexEntities/HtmSerializer.cs#L319

===

# IsMultiDimensionalArray(object obj)

This is a private static method in C# that checks if a given object is a multidimensional array.

Operation: The method takes an object type input and casts it to an Array type.
