## Method Serialize line 487 to 550
 
Here is the beginning of the code to understand which parameters takes the methods
```
 /// <summary>
        /// 
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="obj"></param>
        /// <param name="name"></param>
        /// <param name="sw"></param>
        /// <param name="propertyType"></param>
        /// <param name="ignoreMembers"></param>
        public static void Serialize(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, Type propertyType = null, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)
```

This is a method for serializing an object to a file using the StreamWriter class. 
The method takes in several parameters including the object to be serialized, a name for the object, 
a StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to, and optional parameters for the property type and a list of members to ignore during serialization. 
The method first checks if the object is null and returns if it is. 
It then determines the type of the object and checks if it implements the ISerializable interface or is a primitive or string type. 
If so, it calls the appropriate method for serializing the object. If the object is a dictionary or list, it calls the appropriate method for serializing those types. 
If the object is a KeyValuePair, it calls the SerializeKeyValuePair method. If the object is a class, 
it checks if the object has been serialized before and uses the serialized version if it has. 
If not, it assigns an ID to the object and adds it to the SerializedHashCodes dictionary, then calls the SerializeObject method to serialize the object. 
Finally, it calls the SerializeEnd method to close the serialized data.

## Method SerializeObject line 554 to 607

public static void SerializeObject(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Serialize method to serialize the properties and fields of a class object. 
It takes in the same parameters as the main Serialize method, plus an optional list of members to ignore during serialization. 
It starts by checking if the object passed in is null, and if it is, it returns immediately. 
It then gets the type of the object and creates lists of the object's properties and fields using the GetProperties and GetFields methods.
It then loops through the properties and fields, checking if the current property or field is in the ignore list or if the property can't be written to. 
If either of these conditions are true, it continues to the next property or field. Otherwise, 
it gets the value of the property or field and calls the main Serialize method to serialize it. 
If it throws an exception while trying to read the property or field, it will print a warning message.

## Method  GetFields from 609 to 617
```
private static List<FieldInfo> GetFields(Type type)
        {
            var fields = type.GetFields(BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly | BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.NonPublic).Where(f => f.GetCustomAttribute<CompilerGeneratedAttribute>() == null).ToList();
            if (type.BaseType != null)
            {
                fields.AddRange(type.BaseType.GetFields(BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.NonPublic).Where(f => f.GetCustomAttribute<CompilerGeneratedAttribute>() == null));
            }

            return fields;
        }

```
This is a **helper** method called by the SerializeObject method, which is used to get the fields of a specific type. 
The method takes in a single parameter, "type", which is the Type of the object for which the fields are to be retrieved.
The method starts by using the Type.GetFields method to get all fields of the type, with specific binding flags passed in to only include declared instance fields, 
both public and non-public. The method filters out fields that have the CompilerGeneratedAttribute using LINQ Where method and then converts the result into a List.
Then it check if the type has a base type and if it does, it adds all the fields of the base type to the fields list using GetFields method.
It returns the final list of fields, which can be used to iterate through the fields of an object and retrieve their values.

## Method GetProperties from 620 to 629
```
private static List<PropertyInfo> GetProperties(Type type)
        {
            var properties = type.GetProperties(BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.NonPublic).ToList();
            //if (type.BaseType != null)
            //{
            //    properties.AddRange(type.BaseType.GetProperties(BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.NonPublic));
            //}

            return properties;
        }
```
This is a **helper** method called by the SerializeObject method, which is used to get the properties of a specific type. The method takes in a single parameter, 
"type", which is the Type of the object for which the properties are to be retrieved.
The method starts by using the Type.GetProperties method to get all properties of the type, 
with specific binding flags passed in to include only declared instance properties, both public and non-public.
It then returns the list of properties, which can be used to iterate through the properties of an object and retrieve their values.
It is worth noting that the commented code was supposed to get the properties of the base type as well but it is commented out which means that it is not currently used, 
so this method will only retrieve the properties of the current type passed to it and not the base type.

## Method  SerializeDistalDendrite from 631 to 643
```
private static void SerializeDistalDendrite(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            var ignoreMembers = new List<string> { nameof(DistalDendrite.ParentCell) };
            SerializeObject(obj, name, sw, ignoreMembers);

            var cell = (obj as DistalDendrite).ParentCell;

            if (isCellsSerialized.Contains(cell.Index) == false)
            {
                isCellsSerialized.Add(cell.Index);
                Serialize((obj as DistalDendrite).ParentCell, nameof(DistalDendrite.ParentCell), sw, ignoreMembers: ignoreMembers);
            }
        }
```
This is a **helper** method called by the main Serialize method to serialize a DistalDendrite object. 
It takes in the same parameters as the main Serialize method (the object to be serialized, a name for the object, 
and a StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to).
It starts by creating a new list of members to ignore during serialization, which includes the "ParentCell" property of the DistalDendrite object. 
Then it calls the SerializeObject method, passing in the object, the name, the StreamWriter, and the ignore list.
It then gets the ParentCell property of the DistalDendrite object and checks if it has been serialized before by checking if it exists in isCellsSerialized list, 
if not it adds it to the list and call the Serialize method to serialize the ParentCell object, passing in the ParentCell object, the name "ParentCell", the StreamWriter, 
and the ignore list as parameters.
This method is specifically for the DistalDendrite class and it is used to serialize the parent cell object and make sure it is not serialized multiple times.

## Method  SerializeHtmConfig from 645 to 653
```
private static void SerializeHtmConfig(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            var excludeEntries = new List<string> { nameof(HtmConfig.Random) };
            SerializeObject(obj, name, sw, excludeEntries);

            var htmConfig = obj as HtmConfig;
            Serialize(htmConfig.RandomGenSeed, nameof(HtmConfig.Random), sw);

        }
```
This is a **helper** method called by the main Serialize method to serialize a HtmConfig object. 
It takes in the same parameters as the main Serialize method (the object to be serialized, a name for the object, 
and a StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to).
It starts by creating a new list of members to ignore during serialization, which includes the "Random" property of the HtmConfig object. 
Then it calls the SerializeObject method, passing in the object, the name, the StreamWriter, and the ignore list.
It then gets the HtmConfig object and calls the Serialize method to serialize the "Random" property, passing in the RandomGenSeed, 
the name "Random" and the StreamWriter as parameters.
This method is specifically for the HtmConfig class and it is used to exclude the "Random" property from the serialization while still serializing the RandomGenSeed property.

## Method  SerializeHomeostaticPlasticityController from 655 to 670
```
private static void SerializeHomeostaticPlasticityController(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            var excludeEntries = new List<string> { "m_OnStabilityStatusChanged" };
            SerializeObject(obj, name, sw, excludeEntries);
        }
        #endregion
        #region Deserialization

        //public static T Deserialize<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName = null)
        //{
        //    var type = typeof(T);

        //    T obj = ReadContent<T>(sr, propName);

        //    return obj;
        //}
```
This is a **helper** method called by the main Serialize method to serialize a HomeostaticPlasticityController object. 
It takes in the same parameters as the main Serialize method (the object to be serialized, a name for the object, 
and a StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to).
It starts by creating a new list of members to ignore during serialization, 
which includes the "m_OnStabilityStatusChanged" field of the HomeostaticPlasticityController object. 
Then it calls the SerializeObject method, passing in the object, the name, the StreamWriter, and the ignore list.
The method then ends with the region Deserialization, which contains the definition of a Deserialize method but is commented out, 
this method is not currently in use. It's purpose would be to deserialize the object by reading the contents of the StreamReader and returning the deserialized object of the type T.

## Method  T Deserialize from 672 to 720

public static T Deserialize<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName = null)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Deserialize method to deserialize an object. It takes in a single parameter, a StreamReader sr, which contains the serialized data, 
and an optional string propName, which is the name of the property being deserialized.
The method starts by defining a default value for the output object and getting the type of the object to be deserialized. 
It then check if the type of the object to be deserialized implements the ISerializable interface, 
if yes it finds the Deserialize method of that type by looking for the method which named Deserialize, is static and has two parameters by using reflection. 
it then calls the method using the invoke method and passing the sr and propName as arguments.
Otherwise, the method checks if the type is a value type, a dictionary, a list, or a KeyValuePair, it calls the corresponding method to deserialize these types.
Otherwise, it calls the DeserializeObject method to deserialize the object and returns the deserialized object of the type T.
It's worth noting that this method is generic and can be used to deserialize any type of object.

## Method T DeserializeKeyValuePair from 722 to 785
  
private static T DeserializeKeyValuePair<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName)

This is a **helper** method called by the main Deserialize method to deserialize a KeyValuePair object. 
It takes in the same parameters as the main Deserialize method (a StreamReader sr and an optional string propName).
The method starts by defining default values for the key and value of the KeyValuePair, 
getting the types of the key and the value, and using reflection to get the generic version of the Deserialize method, the ReadGenericBegin method and the ReadGenericEnd method.
Then it reads the content of the StreamReader line by line until the end of the file, and for each line, it checks if it starts with the beginKey or the beginValue, 
it calls the Deserialize method passing the keyType or the valueType as a generic argument, to deserialize the key or the value respectively.
Then it creates the key-value pair object by calling the Activator.CreateInstance method passing the type of the key-value pair, the key and the value as arguments.
It returns the deserialized key-value pair object.

## Method DeserializeCell from 787 to 796

private static object DeserializeCell(StreamReader sr, string propName)
````
private static object DeserializeCell(StreamReader sr, string propName)
        {
            var cell = DeserializeObject<Cell>(sr, propName);

            foreach (var distalDentrite in cell.DistalDendrites)
            {
                distalDentrite.ParentCell = cell;
            }
            return cell;
        }
````
This is a **helper** method called by the main Deserialize method to deserialize a Cell object. It takes in the same parameters as the main Deserialize method 
(a StreamReader sr and an optional string propName)
The method starts by calling the main Deserialize method with a generic argument of type Cell, passing the StreamReader as an argument. 
This will deserialize the cell object from the StreamReader.
Then it loops through the DistalDendrites of the deserialized cell object, and sets the ParentCell property of each DistalDendrite to the deserialized cell object.
It returns the deserialized cell object with the correct ParentCell properties set for the DistalDendrites.

## Method T DeserializeIEnumerable from 798 to 868

private static T DeserializeIEnumerable<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName)

This is a method that deserializes an object of a generic type T that implements the IEnumerable interface, such as lists or arrays. 
The method first determines the type of the elements in the enumerable by checking if the type is a generic type or an array. 
It then creates an empty list and reads each line of the input stream, checking if it is a valid element of the enumerable. 
If it is, it deserializes the element and adds it to the list. Once all elements have been read, the method converts the list to the appropriate type 
(e.g. array or List<T>) using the Enumerable class's ToArray or ToList methods, and returns the resulting object.
It also handle case when the element is int, it will deserialize the string of array of ints, split it by ',' and convert it back to int. 
It also handles case when the element is multidimensional array.

## Method DeserializeMultidimensionalArray from 870 to 931

private static Array DeserializeMultidimensionalArray(StreamReader sr, string propName, Type arrayType)

This code defines methods for deserializing a C# object from a stream. The Deserialize<T> method is the main method and it is used to deserialize any type of object.
The method checks if the type of the object to be deserialized is a value type, a dictionary, a list, or a KeyValuePair, 
and calls the appropriate helper method to deserialize the object. If the type of the object is not any of the above, it deserializes the object as a regular object.
The DeserializeMultidimensionalArray method is used to deserialize multidimensional arrays. 
It reads the rank of the array and the size of each dimension and creates an array with the specified size and rank.

## Method CastListToType from 933 to 938

private static object CastListToType(List<object> enumerable, Type elementType)

````
 private static object CastListToType(List<object> enumerable, Type elementType)
        {
            var castMethod = typeof(Enumerable).GetMethod("Cast").MakeGenericMethod(elementType);
            var enumerableCast = castMethod.Invoke(null, new object[] { enumerable });
            return enumerableCast;
        }
````

The CastListToType method is used to convert a list of objects to a specific type. 
It uses the Cast method of the System.Linq.Enumerable class to do the conversion.
## Method DeserializeDictionary from 940 to 1003 

private static T DeserializeDictionary<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName)

This method deserialize a dictionary from a stream reader. It starts by creating an instance of the dictionary using the Activator.CreateInstance method. 
It then gets the generic argument types for the keys and values of the dictionary. 
It then sets up some variables and methods that will be used later in the method such as the beginKey, beginValue, beginKeyValuePair, endKeyValuePair, and deserializeMethod.
It enters a while loop that continues until there are no more lines left in the stream reader. It reads a line from the stream and trims it. 
It then checks if the line is the end of the dictionary, if it is empty, or if it is the beginning of a key-value pair. If it is the end of the dictionary or empty, 
the loop continues. If it is the beginning of a key-value pair, the values for key and value are reset to null.
If the line starts with the beginKey, it gets the specified type for the key and deserializes it. If the line starts with the beginValue, 
it gets the specified type for the value and deserializes it. Once both the key and value are not null, it attempts to add the key-value pair to the dictionary using the TryAdd or Add method depending on the type of the dictionary.
 
***Some definitions***
###### Helper method
> A helper method is a small, reusable piece of code that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of the program to perform that task. 
Helper methods are often used to encapsulate complex logic or repetitive tasks, making the code that calls them more readable and easier to understand. 
They can also be used to provide a simplified interface to a more complex piece of code. 
Helper methods are commonly used in object-oriented programming and are often defined as private or protected methods within a class, 
so they can only be accessed by the class or its derived classes. They can also be defined as static methods in a separate utility class.



=========

# The code is an example of custom serialization, it's a class called HtmSerializer which contains several methods that handle the serialization and deserialization of different types. The methods include:


# SerializeBegin(string typeName, StreamWriter sw) - This method is used to write the start marker of the type that is being serialized.


The expected parameter:

typeName: a string that represents the type name.
sw: a StreamWriter object that is used to write a string to a stream.

The expected output:none.

-Example

``` 

 public void SerializeBegin(String typeName, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            //
            // -- BEGIN ---
            // typeName
            sw.WriteLine();
            sw.Write($"{TypeDelimiter} BEGIN '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            sw.WriteLine();

        }
		
```		
===

# ReadBegin(string typeName) - This method reads the start marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected parameter:

typeName: a string that represents the type name.

The expected output:

A string that consists of a type delimiter, the word "BEGIN", the type name in single quotes, and another type delimiter.

-Example

```

public String ReadBegin(string typeName)
        {
            string val = ($"{TypeDelimiter} BEGIN '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            return val;
        }

```
===

```
public static void Reset()
        {
            SerializedHashCodes.Clear();
            MapObjectHashCode.Clear();
            Id = 0;
        }
```

This code is defining a static method "Reset" in a class. The method has three operations:

It clears the contents of a dictionary "SerializedHashCodes".
It clears the contents of another dictionary "MapObjectHashCode".
It sets the static field "Id" to 0.


The function "Reset" is a public static method in some program.
It doesn't take any input.

The function performs the following operations:

Clears the "SerializedHashCodes" collection.
Clears the "MapObjectHashCode" collection.
Resets the "Id" variable to 0.

The expected output : None
===

```
public static void Save(string fileName, object obj)
        {
            Reset();
            using (var writer = new StreamWriter(fileName))
            {
                Serialize(obj, null, writer);
            }
        }
```

The function "Save" is a public static method in some program.

The input for this function consists of two parameters:

"fileName": a string that specifies the name of the file to be saved.
"obj": an object that needs to be saved.

The function performs the following operations:

Calls the "Reset" method to reset the collections and variable.
Creates a StreamWriter object using the "fileName" parameter as the file name.
Calls the "Serialize" method with the "obj" parameter and a null value, and the created StreamWriter object as arguments.

The expected output : None
===

```
public static T Load<T>(string fileName)
        {
            Reset();
            using (var reader = new StreamReader(fileName))
            {
                return Deserialize<T>(reader);
            }
        }
```

The function "Load" is a public "static" method in some program.

The input for this function is a single parameter:

"fileName": a string that specifies the name of the file to be loaded.

The function performs the following operations:

Calls the "Reset" method to reset the collections and variable.
Creates a StreamReader object using the "fileName" parameter as the file name.
Calls the "Deserialize" method with the created StreamReader object as an argument and returns the result.

The function returns an object of the generic type "T", which is specified as a type parameter when calling the function.
===

```
public static bool TryLoad<T>(string fileName, out T obj)
        {
            if (File.Exists(fileName) == false)
            {
                obj = default;
                return false;
            }
            obj = Load<T>(fileName);
            return true;
        }
```

The function "TryLoad" is a public static method in some program.

The input for this function consists of two parameters:

"fileName": a string that specifies the name of the file to be loaded.
"obj": an output parameter of type "T", which is a generic type specified when calling the function.

The function performs the following operations:

Checks if the file specified by the "fileName" parameter exists using the "File.Exists" method.
If the file doesn't exist, sets the "obj" parameter to its default value and returns "false".
If the file exists, calls the "Load" method with the "fileName" parameter and assigns the result to the "obj" parameter.
Returns "true".

The function returns a "bool" value indicating whether the file was successfully loaded or not.
===

# SerializeEnd(string typeName, StreamWriter sw) - This method writes the end marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected parameter:

"typeName": a string that represents the name of a type.
"sw": a StreamWriter object that represents the output stream where the data is to be written.

The function performs the following operation:

Writes an empty line to the StreamWriter object.
Writes a string in the format of "{TypeDelimiter} END '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}" to the StreamWriter object, where "TypeDelimiter" is a constant string in the program and "typeName" is the input parameter.
Writes another empty line to the StreamWriter object.

The expected output: None

-Example

```
public void SerializeEnd(String typeName, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            sw.WriteLine();
            sw.Write($"{TypeDelimiter} END '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            sw.WriteLine();
        }

```
===

#	ReadEnd(string typeName) - This method reads the end marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected parameter:

a single input argument typeName of type 'String'.

The expected output:

a 'String' value that is constructed by concatenating the value of the 'TypeDelimiter' constant, the string " END '", 'typeName' (the input argument), the string "' " and the value of the 'TypeDelimiter' constant again.

-Example

```

public String ReadEnd(String typeName)
        {
            string val = ($"{TypeDelimiter} END '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            return val;
        }
```		
===

#	SerializeValue(int val, StreamWriter sw) - This method writes the value of an integer type property.

The expected parameter:

an integer value "val" and a StreamWriter object "sw"

The expected output: none, but it writes the following to the stream associated with the "sw" StreamWriter object:
A ValueDelimiter string
The string representation of the "val" integer, obtained by calling "val.ToString()"
Another ValueDelimiter string
A ParameterDelimiter string.

```
 public void SerializeValue(int val, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            sw.Write(ValueDelimiter);
            sw.Write(val.ToString());
            sw.Write(ValueDelimiter);
            sw.Write(ParameterDelimiter);
        }
```		

===

#  Serialize(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, Type propertyType = null, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

method that serializes an object into a string representation using a StreamWriter. The method checks the type of the input object and serializes it based on its type.

If the object implements the ISerializable interface, it will serialize the object using the 'Serialize' method from the ISerializable interface. If the object has already been serialized, it will serialize the previously assigned ID instead of the object.
If the object is a primitive type (e.g. int, bool, float) or a string, it will serialize its value.
If the object is a dictionary, it will serialize the dictionary.
If the object is a list or an IEnumerable, it will serialize it as an IEnumerable.
If the object is a KeyValuePair, it will serialize the KeyValuePair.
If the object is a class, it will serialize the object using the 'SerializeObject' method. If the object has already been serialized, it will serialize the previously assigned ID instead of the object.
The method also keeps track of the serialized objects using a dictionary 'SerializedHashCodes'.

The expected parameter:
obj: an object of any type
name: a string representing the name of the object
sw: a StreamWriter object
propertyType: (optional) a Type object, representing the type of the object
ignoreMembers: (optional) a list of strings, representing members to ignore during serialization

The expected output: none, 

```
        public static void Serialize(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, Type propertyType = null, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)
        {
            if (obj == null)

# SerializeKeyValuePair(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw)

The function serializes an object of a generic type that represents a Key-Value pair (e.g. KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>) by extracting the key and value properties of the object, and serializing each of them separately.

It does this by:

Getting the type of the object being serialized and extracting the generic argument types (keyType and valueType).
Finding the key and value fields of the object using the GetFields method, which is presumably a helper method that returns an array of fields for a given type.
Serializing the key and value fields using the Serialize method, which is presumably another helper method.

The expected parameters to this function is: an object of a generic type that represents a Key-Value pair, along with a 'StreamWriter' instance to write the serialized data to.
name: a string that represents the name of the object being serialized.
obj: an object to be serialized.
sw: a StreamWriter instance that will be used to write the serialized data to a stream.

The expected output: none 

```
private static void SerializeKeyValuePair(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            var type = obj.GetType();
            var keyType = type.GetGenericArguments()[0];
            var valueType = type.GetGenericArguments()[1];

            var keyField = GetFields(type).FirstOrDefault(f => f.Name == "key");
            if (keyField != null)
            {
                var key = keyField.GetValue(obj);
                Serialize(key, "Key", sw, keyType);

# Serialize1(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, Dictionary<Type, Action<StreamWriter, string, object>> customSerializers = null)

The function 'Serialize1' is a serialization function that takes an 'object' as input along with its 'name' and a 'StreamWriter' instance, 'sw',
and an optional 'Dictionary<Type, Action<StreamWriter, string, object>>' for custom serialization of objects of specific types.

The function starts by checking if the input 'obj' is null and returns immediately if that's the case. Otherwise, it retrieves the 'type' of the input 'obj'.
Then, it calls 'SerializeBegin' with 'name' and 'sw' as parameters to serialize the beginning of the object.
Next, it performs type checking for 'obj' and serializes it based on its type. If the type is a primitive type or a 'string', it calls 'SerializeValue' with 'name', 'obj', and 'sw'
as parameters to serialize the value. If the type is a dictionary, it calls 'SerializeDictionary' with 'name', 'obj', and 'sw' as parameters.
If it's a list, it calls 'SerializeIEnumerable' with 'name', 'obj', and 'sw' as parameters. If the type is a class or value type and there's a custom serializer in the 'customSerializers'
dictionary for this type, it calls the corresponding action with 'sw', 'name', and 'obj' as parameters.

Finally, it calls 'SerializeEnd' with 'name' and 'sw' as parameters to serialize the end of the object.

The expected input:
obj: the object to be serialized.
name: the name of the object.
sw: a StreamWriter instance to write the serialized data to.
customSerializers (optional): a dictionary containing custom serializers for specific types.

The expected output: none

```
public static void Serialize1(object obj, string name,
            StreamWriter sw, Dictionary<Type, Action<StreamWriter, string, object>> customSerializers = null)
        {
            if (obj == null)
            {
                return;
            }
            var type = obj.GetType();

# SerializeDictionary(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

The function operates as follows:

It first checks if the type of the obj is a generic type.
If the type is generic, it retrieves the key and value types of the dictionary.
If the key type is not of type string, the function does nothing.
The function then casts the obj to an IEnumerable type and loops through each item in the enumerable.
For each item, it retrieves its properties and serializes each property using the Serialize function.
The Serialize function takes the property value, name, StreamWriter, type, and a list of members to ignore as parameters.

The expected parameters:
name: a string that represents the name of the dictionary object.
obj: an object of any type that needs to be serialized.
sw: a StreamWriter object that writes characters to a stream.
ignoreMembers: an optional parameter of type List<string> that contains members to ignore during serialization.

The expected output: none.

```
 private static void SerializeDictionary(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)
        {
            var type = obj.GetType();
            if (type.IsGenericType)
            {

                {

                }

                var enumerable = ((IEnumerable)obj);

                foreach (var item in enumerable)

#SerializeBegin(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type)

The function writes the serialized representation of the beginning of a property to a stream and operates as follows:

It creates a list of strings listString with the value "Begin".
If the propName is not null or empty, it adds the propName to the listString.
If the type parameter is not null, it adds the full name of the type (without spaces) to the listString.
The function then writes the joined elements of the listString to the StreamWriter object, separated by a space character.

The expected parameters:
propName: a string that represents the name of a property.
sw: a StreamWriter object that writes characters to a stream.
type: an optional parameter of type Type that represents the type of the property.

The expected output:none.

 ```
 private static void SerializeBegin(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type)
        {
            var listString = new List<string> { "Begin" };

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(propName) == false)
            {
                listString.Add(propName);
            }
            if (type != null)
            {
                listString.Add(type.FullName.Replace(" ", ""));
            }

            sw.WriteLine(String.Join(' ', listString));
        }
```
===

#SerializeEnd(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type)


The expected parameters:
propName: a string representing the property name.
sw: a StreamWriter object.
type: a Type object.

The function operates as follows:

Writes a new line to the StreamWriter object sw.
Creates a list of strings listString and adds the string "End" to it.
If propName is not null or empty, it adds propName to listString.
If type is not null, it adds the full name of type to listString after removing spaces.
Writes the joined string of listString to the StreamWriter object sw.

The expected output:none.

```
private static void SerializeEnd(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type)
        {
            sw.WriteLine();
            var listString = new List<string> { "End" };

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(propName) == false)
            {
                listString.Add(propName);
            }
            if (type != null)
            {
                listString.Add(type.FullName.Replace(" ", ""));

# ReadGenericBegin(string propName, Type type = null)

The expected parameters:
propName: a string representing the property name.
type: a Type object (with a default value of null).

The expected output:

Creates a list of strings listString and adds the string "Begin" to it.
If propName is not null or empty, it adds propName to listString.
If type is not null, it adds the full name of type to listString after removing spaces.
Returns the joined string of listString.

```
private static string ReadGenericBegin(string propName, Type type = null)
        {
            var listString = new List<string> { "Begin" };

            return String.Join(' ', listString);
        }
```
===

#SerializeValue(string propertyName, object val, StreamWriter sw)

The method operates as follows:

The ToString() method is called on the val object to get its string representation.
If val is of type string, then any line breaks within the string are replaced with the string "\n".
Finally, the resulting string is written to the StreamWriter object sw using the Write method.

The expected parameter:
propertyName: a string representing the name of a property
val: an object that needs to be serialized into a string
sw: a StreamWriter object, which is a type of stream that can be used to write text data to a file or other data stream.

The expected output:none.

```
public static void SerializeValue(string propertyName, object val, StreamWriter sw)
        {

            var content = val.ToString();
            if (val.GetType() == typeof(string))
            {
                content = content.Replace("\n", "\\n");
            }
            sw.Write(content);
        }

#SerializeIEnumerable(string propertyName, object obj, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

The function 'SerializeIEnumerable' is a method that serializes an object that implements the IEnumerable interface into a string representation and
writes it to a StreamWriter object.

The method operates as follows:

The type of the obj object is checked to determine if it is a multidimensional array or a collection of items.
If it is a multidimensional array, the method calls SerializeMultidimensionalArray to serialize the array.
If it is a collection of integers, the method creates a comma-separated string from the items and calls Serialize with the string and a property name of "ArrayContent".
If it is a collection of objects, the method iterates over the items and calls Serialize on each item, passing in the item,
the property name "CollectionItem", the StreamWriter object, the type of the elements, and the ignoreMembers list.

The expected output:none.

```
 private static void SerializeIEnumerable(string propertyName, object obj, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)
        {
            var type = obj.GetType();
            if (IsMultiDimensionalArray(obj))
            {
                SerializeMultidimensionalArray(obj, propertyName, sw);
                return;
            }

            var enumerable = ((IEnumerable)obj);

            if (type.GetElementType() == typeof(int) || (type.IsGenericType && type.GetGenericArguments()[0] == typeof(int)))
            {
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                foreach (var item in enumerable)
                {

                    sb.Append(',');
                }
                string arrayStringContent = sb.ToString().TrimEnd(',');

                Serialize(arrayStringContent, "ArrayContent", sw);
                return;
            }

#IsMultiDimensionalArray(object obj)

This is a private static method in C# that checks if a given object is a multidimensional array.

Operation: The method takes an object type input and casts it to an Array type.
 If the cast is successful and the Rank property of the array is greater than 1, it returns true because it is a multidimensional array.
If the cast is not successful or the Rank is 1 or less, it returns false.

The expected parameter: an object type.

The expected output: a bool type and is true if the input obj is a multidimensional array, and false otherwise.

```
 private static bool IsMultiDimensionalArray(object obj)
        {
            var array = obj as Array;

            return false;
        }
```
===

#SerializeMultidimensionalArray(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)

Operation: it writes the serialized representation of the multi-dimensional array to the StreamWriter object.
The serialization process includes writing the rank of the array, the dimensions, the default value of the elements,
 and the elements with non-default values along with their indexes.
The serialization is done using calls to other functions like SerializeBegin, SerializeValue, Serialize, and SerializeEnd.

The expected parameter:
obj: an object which should be a multi-dimensional array.
name: a string representing the name of the array.
sw: a StreamWriter object that is used to write the serialized output.

The expected output:none.


```
        private static void SerializeMultidimensionalArray(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            var array = obj as Array;

                                }
                            }

                                var field = fields.FirstOrDefault(f => f.Name == components[1]);
                                if (field != null && field.IsInitOnly == false)
                                {
                                    var implementedType = GetType(components[2]);

                                    if (implementedType != null)
                                    {
                                        var deserializeMethod = typeof(HtmSerializer).GetMethod(nameof(HtmSerializer.Deserialize)).MakeGenericMethod(implementedType);

                                        var fieldValue = deserializeMethod.Invoke(null, new object[] { sr, field.Name });

                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            // Deserialize the excluded fields or properties
                            action?.Invoke(obj, components[1]);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
               return obj;
        }
````
   The method first checks if the type is an interface or abstract and if it is, it returns the default value of the type. It then creates an instance of the type using Activator.CreateInstance, gets the properties and fields of the type, and reads the StreamReader line by line. 
   It then checks for specific keywords in the line and performs different actions based on the keyword. If the line starts with "Begin", it checks for specific keywords and deserializes different properties or fields accordingly. 
   It also keeps track of the objects deserialized using a hashcode and stores them in a map.

## **METHOD 2 (1184-1198): DeserializeHtmConfig**
   This is a C# method that deserializes an object of type "HtmConfig" from a stream reader. 
   The method takes in two parameters: "sr" which is the stream reader and "propertyName" which is the name of the property, type is string.The method takes two inputs:
   A StreamReader object "sr" which is used to read a stream of data, usually a file or network stream. The method reads the data from the stream and deserializes it into an object of type "HtmConfig".
   A string "propertyName", which is used as a reference to the property being deserialized. This string is passed along to other methods called within this method such as "DeserializeObject" and "Deserialize".
````
    private static object DeserializeHtmConfig(StreamReader sr, string propertyName)
  
        {
            var excludeEntries = new List<string> { nameof(HtmConfig.Random) };
            var htmConfig = DeserializeObject<HtmConfig>(sr, propertyName, excludeEntries, (config, propertyName) =>
            {
                if (propertyName == nameof(HtmConfig.Random))
                {
                    var seed = Deserialize<int>(sr, propertyName);
                    config.Random = new ThreadSafeRandom(seed);
                }
            });
    
            return htmConfig;
       }
````
    The method creates a new list of strings called "excludeEntries" which contains the name of the property "Random" and uses it to exclude it from the deserialization process.
    The method then creates a new instance of "ThreadSafeRandom" using the seed and assigns it to the "Random" property of the "HtmConfig" object.
    Finally, the method returns the deserialized "HtmConfig" object.
    Additionally, the method relies on other methods such as "DeserializeObject" and "Deserialize", which are necessary to understand the full functionality of this method.
## **METHOD 3 (1200-1226): T DeserializeValue<T>** 
    The input of this code is a StreamReader "sr" and a string "propertyName". The StreamReader reads the content from a stream and the string "propertyName" is the name of the property being deserialized.
    This method appears to be deserializing a single value of a specified generic type "T" from a StreamReader (the StreamReader "sr" and the contents of the stream it is reading from).
````
    private static T DeserializeValue<T>(StreamReader sr, string propertyName)
        {
            T obj = default;
            while (sr.Peek() > 0)
            {
                var content = sr.ReadLine().Trim();

                if (content == ReadGenericEnd(propertyName))
                {
                    break;
                }
                if (content == ReadGenericBegin(propertyName))
                {
                    continue;
                }

                var type = typeof(T);

                if (type == typeof(string))
                {
                    content = content.Replace("\\n", "\n");
                }
                obj = (T)Convert.ChangeType(content, type);
    
            }
            return obj;
        }
        #endregion
````
    The method reads lines from the StreamReader until it reaches a line that matches the end marker for the property, and uses the Convert.ChangeType method to convert each line read to the specified type "T" before returning the final converted value.
    A special case is made for strings, where newline characters "\n" are replaced with actual newlines "\n" before being casted to the type T.
    As well as the implementation of the "ReadGenericEnd" and "ReadGenericBegin" methods used within the method. 
    Additionally, the output will depend on the specific type of the generic parameter "T" that is passed to the method.

## **METHOD 4 (1265-1284): SerializeValue**
    This code is a method that serializes an object to a text stream using a StreamWriter.
    The method takes input in three parameters: the object to be serialized, the type of the object, and the StreamWriter to write the serialized object to.
    The method first checks if the object is a value type (such as an int or a struct) using the IsValueType property.
 ````
    public void SerializeValue(object val, Type type, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            if (type.IsValueType)
            {
                sw.Write(ValueDelimiter);
                sw.Write(val.ToString());
                sw.Write(ValueDelimiter);
                sw.Write(ParameterDelimiter);
   
            }
            else
            {
                var method = type.GetMethod("Serialize", System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Public | System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Instance);
                if (method != null)
                {
                    method.Invoke(val, new object[] { sw });
  
                }
                else
                    throw new NotSupportedException($"No serialization implemented on the type {type}!");
 
            }
        }
````
    If it is a value type, it writes the value of the object to the StreamWriter surrounded by a delimiter.
    If it is not a value type, it looks for a method called "Serialize" on the object's type and invokes it, passing in the StreamWriter as a parameter.
    If no such method is found, it throws a NotSupportedException.
    The output of this code is the serialization of the input object in the form of text written to the input StreamWriter.
    It does not return anything, it just writes the serialized form of the object to the StreamWriter.

## **METHOD 5 (1286-1306): DeserializeValue**
   This method is a generic method that deserializes a value of type T from a StreamReader.
   We need StreamReader and the value of the ParameterDelimiter for output.
````
    public T DeserializeValue<T>(StreamReader sr)
        {
            Type type = typeof(T);
       if (type.IsValueType)
            {       
                var reader = sr.ReadLine().Trim().Replace(ParameterDelimiter.ToString(), "");
                return (T)Convert.ChangeType(reader, type);
            }
            else
            {
                var method = type.GetMethod("Deserialize");
                if (method != null)
                {
                    return (T)method.Invoke(null, new object[] { sr });
                }
                else
                    throw new NotSupportedException($"No de-serialization implemented on the type {type}!");
 
            }
       }
````
   If T is a value type, the method reads a line from the StreamReader, trims it, and replaces a specified delimiter with an empty string.
   Then it converts the string to the type T and returns it.
   If T is not a value type, the method uses reflection to look for a method called "Deserialize" on the type T, and if it exists, it invokes that method and returns the result.
   If the "Deserialize" method does not exist, it throws a NotSupportedException.
   We need StreamReader and the value of the ParameterDelimiter for output.

## **METHOD 6 (1332-1356): DeserializeSynapse**
  This code is deserializing a Synapse object from a text file using a StreamReader.
  The input of this code is a StreamReader object that is connected to a text file. 
  The text file should contain serialized information about a Synapse object in a specific format that is understood by the "Deserialize" method of the Synapse class and the "ReadBegin" method. 
  It reads lines of data from the file until it reaches a line that matches the string returned by the "ReadBegin" method with the parameter "nameof(Synapse)".
  It then calls the "Deserialize" method on the Synapse class, passing in the StreamReader.
 ````
    public Synapse DeserializeSynapse(StreamReader sr)
        {
            while (sr.Peek() >= 0)
            {
                string data = sr.ReadLine();

                if (data == ReadBegin(nameof(Synapse)))
                {
                    Synapse synapseT1 = Synapse.Deserialize(sr);

                    Cell cell1 = synapseT1.SourceCell;
                    DistalDendrite distSegment1 = synapseT1.SourceCell.DistalDendrites[0];

                    DistalDendrite distSegment2 = synapseT1.SourceCell.DistalDendrites[1];

                    distSegment1.ParentCell = cell1;
                    distSegment2.ParentCell = cell1;
                    synapseT1.SourceCell = cell1;

                    return synapseT1;
                }
            }
            return null;
        }
````
	The resulting Synapse object is stored in the "synapseT1" variable. The code then gets the SourceCell property of "synapseT1" and assigns it to "cell1".
	It also gets the DistalDendrites property of "cell1" at index 0 and 1 and assigns them to "distSegment1" and "distSegment2" respectively.
	Finally, it sets the ParentCell property of "distSegment1" and "distSegment2" to "cell1" and the SourceCell property of "synapseT1" to "cell1" and returns "synapseT1".
	If the end of the file is reached, the function returns null.
    The output of this code would be an instance of the Synapse class that has been deserialized from a text file using a StreamReader. 
    If it could not find the string returned by "ReadBegin" method with the parameter "nameof(Synapse)", it would return null.

## **METHOD 7 (1363-1385): DeserializeDistalDendrite**
   The input of this code is a StreamReader object, which is passed as an argument to the method. 
   The StreamReader object is used to read the data that is used to deserialize the DistalDendrite object. 
   This is a method in C# that deserializes a DistalDendrite object from a StreamReader object. 
   The method reads lines of data from the StreamReader and checks if the line of data is the start of a DistalDendrite object. 
   If it is, it creates a DistalDendrite object using the  DistalDendrite.
   Deserialize method and sets its ParentCell property.
 ````
    public DistalDendrite DeserializeDistalDendrite(StreamReader sr)
        {
            while (sr.Peek() >= 0)
            {
                string data = sr.ReadLine();

                if (data == ReadBegin(nameof(DistalDendrite)))
                {

                    DistalDendrite distSegment1 = DistalDendrite.Deserialize(sr);

                    Cell cell1 = distSegment1.ParentCell;
                    distSegment1 = distSegment1.ParentCell.DistalDendrites[0];
                    distSegment1.ParentCell = cell1;
                    DistalDendrite distSegment2 = distSegment1.ParentCell.DistalDendrites[1];
                    distSegment2.ParentCell = cell1;

                    return distSegment1;
                }
            }
            return null;
 
        }
````
   It then sets the ParentCell property of the first and second DistalDendrite in the ParentCell.DistalDendrites list. Finally, it returns the first DistalDendrite object.
   If no DistalDendrite is found, it returns null.
   This code is a method that appears to deserialize a DistalDendrite object from a StreamReader object, and sets the ParentCell property of the object and its first two DistalDendrites to the same Cell object, and returns the first DistalDendrite object. 
   If the marker string "ReadBegin(nameof(DistalDendrite))" is not found in the stream, the method will return null. 
   So the output of this code is a DistalDendrite object if the marker is found in the stream otherwise it will return null.

 ## **METHOD 8 (1392-1398): SerializeValue**
 ````
    public void SerializeValue(double val, StreamWriter sw) 
        {
            sw.Write(ValueDelimiter);
            sw.Write(string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "{0:0.000}", val));
            sw.Write(ValueDelimiter);
            sw.Write(ParameterDelimiter);
        }
 ````
   This is a method that serializes a double value to a StreamWriter.
   The method starts by writing a ValueDelimiter to the StreamWriter, then it formats the double value using the CultureInfo.InvariantCulture and a format of "0.000" and writes it to the StreamWriter. 
   After that, it writes another ValueDelimiter and a ParameterDelimiter to the StreamWriter. This method is likely used to write double values to a file or other stream in a specific format.
   The output of this code would be the double value passed as an argument to the method, formatted as a string with three decimal places, preceded by a ValueDelimiter and followed by a ValueDelimiter and a ParameterDelimiter. 
   For example, if the method is called with the value of 1.234, the output written to the StreamWriter would be something like this: "|1.234|,".
   It is important to note that the method does not return any output, it writes the output to the StreamWriter passed as argument.

   #How to use HtmSerializer

##Introduction
The purpose of this document is to explain the methods in the Serializer, in order to have a better understanding of how HtmSerializer works.

##Methods
**Method SerializeBegin:** public void SerializeBegin(String typeName, StreamWriter sw)

This method indicates the start of the serialize object by writing a variable called "TypeDelimiter" before and after the serialize object

-Expected parameters: 
1. A string called typeName that is the object we want to serialize
2. An object Streamwriter that will write the text to the stream.
-Return value: none 
-Example:
```
 public void SerializeBegin(String typeName, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            //
            // -- BEGIN ---
            // typeName
       
            sw.WriteLine();

            sw.Write($"{TypeDelimiter} BEGIN '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            sw.WriteLine();

        }
```


**Method SerializeEnd:** public void SerializeEnd(String typeName, StreamWriter sw)

This method indicates the end of the serialize object by writing a variable called "TypeDelimiter" before and after the serialize object

-Expected intput: 
1. A string call typeName that is the object we want to serialize.
2. An object Streamwriter that will write the text to the stream.

-Return value: none  
-Example:
```
public void SerializeEnd(String typeName, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            sw.WriteLine();
       
            sw.Write($"{TypeDelimiter} END '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            sw.WriteLine();
        }

```

**Method SerializeValue:**  public void SerializeValue(Dictionary<int, int> keyValues, StreamWriter sw)

This method is formatting the properties of a generic class Dictionary before writing them to a stream. Dictionary is a container class that associates keys with values.

-Expected parameters: 

1. A Dictionary object that contains the key-value pairs to be serialized.
2. StreamWriter object named sw that will be used to write the serialized string to an output stream.
	It is possible to have as an argument instead of the generic class Dictionary a simple variable like a double, int, string, etc. In this case, we will be formatting those arguments passed to the method.

-Return value: none
		

-Example:
```
 public void SerializeValue(Dictionary<int, int> keyValues, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            sw.Write(ValueDelimiter);
            foreach (KeyValuePair<int, int> i in keyValues)
            {
                sw.Write(i.Key.ToString() + KeyValueDelimiter + i.Value.ToString());
                sw.Write(ElementsDelimiter);
            }
            sw.Write(ParameterDelimiter);
        }
```


**Mehtod  Serialize:** public static void Serialize(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, Type propertyType = null, List<string> ignoreMembers = null)

This is a method for serializing an object to a file using the StreamWriter class.


-Expected parameters:
1. The object to be serialized.
2. A string representing the name for the object.
3. A StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to.
4. Optional parameters for the property type and a list of members to ignore during serialization.

-Return value: none

-Example:
```
private static void SerializeDistalDendrite(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            var ignoreMembers = new List<string> { nameof(DistalDendrite.ParentCell) };
            SerializeObject(obj, name, sw, ignoreMembers);

            var cell = (obj as DistalDendrite).ParentCell;

            if (isCellsSerialized.Contains(cell.Index) == false)
            {
                isCellsSerialized.Add(cell.Index);
                Serialize((obj as DistalDendrite).ParentCell, nameof(DistalDendrite.ParentCell), sw, ignoreMembers: ignoreMembers);
            }
        }
```

**Mehtod  SerializeObject:** public static void SerializeObject(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, List ignoreMembers = null)


-Expected parameters:
1. The object to be serialized.
2. A string representing the name for the object.
3. A StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to.
4. A list of members

-Return value: none


**Method SerializeHtmConfig:** private static void SerializeHtmConfig(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)

This is a helper method called by the main Serialize method to serialize a HtmConfig object.

-Expected parameters:
1. The object to be serialized.
2. A string representing the name for the object.
3. A StreamWriter object to write the serialized data to.

-Return value: none

-Example:
```
private static void SerializeHtmConfig(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            var excludeEntries = new List<string> { nameof(HtmConfig.Random) };
            SerializeObject(obj, name, sw, excludeEntries);

            var htmConfig = obj as HtmConfig;
            Serialize(htmConfig.RandomGenSeed, nameof(HtmConfig.Random), sw);

        }
```


**Mehtod  DeserializeObject:** public Cell DeserializeCell(StreamReader sr)

This method deserialize an object that has been previously serialized.

-Example:
```
public Cell DeserializeCell(StreamReader sr)
        {
            while (sr.Peek() >= 0)
            {
                string data = sr.ReadLine();

                if (data == ReadBegin(nameof(Cell)))
                {
                    Cell cell1 = Cell.Deserialize(sr);

                    DistalDendrite distSegment1 = cell1.DistalDendrites[0];

                    DistalDendrite distSegment2 = cell1.DistalDendrites[1];

                    distSegment1.ParentCell = cell1;
                    distSegment2.ParentCell = cell1;

                    return cell1;
                }
            }
            return null;
        }
```
-Expected parameters: a StreamReader object
-Return value: in the example above the method returns a single Cell object, although it is possible to have another output as an array of Cell object. (Cell[])


**Method Deserialize** :public static T Deserialize<T>(StreamReader sr, string propName = null)















A serialized string representation of the method´s first argument written to the output stream specified by the sw StreamWriter object. The format of the string will be in accordance with the code inside the method.
