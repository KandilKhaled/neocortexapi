# The code is an example of custom serialization, it's a class called HtmSerializer which contains several methods that handle the serialization and deserialization of different types. The methods include:

```
public static void Reset()
        {
            SerializedHashCodes.Clear();
            MapObjectHashCode.Clear();
            Id = 0;
        }
```

This code is defining a static method "Reset" in a class. The method has three operations:

It clears the contents of a dictionary "SerializedHashCodes".
It clears the contents of another dictionary "MapObjectHashCode".
It sets the static field "Id" to 0.


The function "Reset" is a public static method in some program.
It doesn't take any input.

The function performs the following operations:

Clears the "SerializedHashCodes" collection.
Clears the "MapObjectHashCode" collection.
Resets the "Id" variable to 0.

The expected output : None
===

```
public static void Save(string fileName, object obj)
        {
            Reset();
            using (var writer = new StreamWriter(fileName))
            {
                Serialize(obj, null, writer);
            }
        }
```

The function "Save" is a public static method in some program.

The input for this function consists of two parameters:

"fileName": a string that specifies the name of the file to be saved.
"obj": an object that needs to be saved.

The function performs the following operations:

Calls the "Reset" method to reset the collections and variable.
Creates a StreamWriter object using the "fileName" parameter as the file name.
Calls the "Serialize" method with the "obj" parameter and a null value, and the created StreamWriter object as arguments.

The expected output : None
===

```
public static T Load<T>(string fileName)
        {
            Reset();
            using (var reader = new StreamReader(fileName))
            {
                return Deserialize<T>(reader);
            }
        }
```

The function "Load" is a public "static" method in some program.

The input for this function is a single parameter:

"fileName": a string that specifies the name of the file to be loaded.

The function performs the following operations:

Calls the "Reset" method to reset the collections and variable.
Creates a StreamReader object using the "fileName" parameter as the file name.
Calls the "Deserialize" method with the created StreamReader object as an argument and returns the result.

The function returns an object of the generic type "T", which is specified as a type parameter when calling the function.
===

```
public static bool TryLoad<T>(string fileName, out T obj)
        {
            if (File.Exists(fileName) == false)
            {
                obj = default;
                return false;
            }
            obj = Load<T>(fileName);
            return true;
        }
```

The function "TryLoad" is a public static method in some program.

The input for this function consists of two parameters:

"fileName": a string that specifies the name of the file to be loaded.
"obj": an output parameter of type "T", which is a generic type specified when calling the function.

The function performs the following operations:

Checks if the file specified by the "fileName" parameter exists using the "File.Exists" method.
If the file doesn't exist, sets the "obj" parameter to its default value and returns "false".
If the file exists, calls the "Load" method with the "fileName" parameter and assigns the result to the "obj" parameter.
Returns "true".

The function returns a "bool" value indicating whether the file was successfully loaded or not.

# SerializeBegin(string typeName, StreamWriter sw) - This method is used to write the start marker of the type that is being serialized.


The expected input of the code is:

typeName: a string that represents the type name.
sw: a StreamWriter object that is used to write a string to a stream.

The expected output of the code is:

Writing a string that consists of a type delimiter, the word "BEGIN", the type name in single quotes, and another type delimiter to the stream represented by the StreamWriter object sw.

-Example

``` 

 public void SerializeBegin(String typeName, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            //
            // -- BEGIN ---
            // typeName
            sw.WriteLine();
            sw.Write($"{TypeDelimiter} BEGIN '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            sw.WriteLine();

        }
		
```		
===

# ReadBegin(string typeName) - This method reads the start marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected input of the code is:

typeName: a string that represents the type name.

The expected output of the code is:

A string that consists of a type delimiter, the word "BEGIN", the type name in single quotes, and another type delimiter.

-Example

```

public String ReadBegin(string typeName)
        {
            string val = ($"{TypeDelimiter} BEGIN '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            return val;
        }

```
===

# SerializeEnd(string typeName, StreamWriter sw) - This method writes the end marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected input of the code is:

"typeName": a string that represents the name of a type.
"sw": a StreamWriter object that represents the output stream where the data is to be written.

The function performs the following operation:

Writes an empty line to the StreamWriter object.
Writes a string in the format of "{TypeDelimiter} END '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}" to the StreamWriter object, where "TypeDelimiter" is a constant string in the program and "typeName" is the input parameter.
Writes another empty line to the StreamWriter object.

-Return Value: None

-Example

```
public void SerializeEnd(String typeName, StreamWriter sw)
        {
            sw.WriteLine();
            sw.Write($"{TypeDelimiter} END '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            sw.WriteLine();
        }

```
===

#	ReadEnd(string typeName) - This method reads the end marker of the type that is being serialized.

The expected input of the code is:

a single input argument typeName of type 'String'.

The expected output of the code is:

a 'String' value that is constructed by concatenating the value of the 'TypeDelimiter' constant, the string " END '", 'typeName' (the input argument), the string "' " and the value of the 'TypeDelimiter' constant again.

-Example

```

public String ReadEnd(String typeName)
        {
            string val = ($"{TypeDelimiter} END '{typeName}' {TypeDelimiter}");
            return val;
        }

5.	SerializeValue(int val, StreamWriter sw) - This method writes the value of an integer type property.
6.	Serialize(object obj, object parent, StreamWriter sw) - This method serializes the object to the stream.
7.	Save(string fileName, object obj) - This method saves the object to the file.
8.	Load<T>(string fileName) - This method loads the object from the file.
9.	TryLoad<T>(string fileName, out T obj) - This method tries to load the object from the file and returns true if the file exists, false otherwise.

It seems the class is handling serialization for simple types like int and also for complex objects, this is done by calling the Serialize method recursively on the properties of the object, and it's also keeping track of the HashCodes of the objects that are being serialized to handle circular references.

1.	SerializeKeyValuePair(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw) - This method is used to serialize KeyValuePair objects. It uses reflection to get the fields of the KeyValuePair object and calls the Serialize method recursively on the key and value properties.
2.	Serialize1(object obj, string name, StreamWriter sw, Dictionary<Type, Action<StreamWriter, string, object>> customSerializers = null) - This method is used to serialize different types of objects. It calls different methods based on the type of the object, such as SerializeBegin, SerializeValue, SerializeDictionary, SerializeIEnumerable, SerializeObject, etc.
3.	SerializeDictionary(string name, object obj, StreamWriter sw, List<string> ignoreMembers = null) - This method is used to serialize Dictionary objects. It iterates through the items of the dictionary and calls the Serialize method recursively on the key and value properties.
4.	SerializeBegin(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type) - This method is used to write the start marker of the object or the property being serialized.
5.	SerializeEnd(string propName, StreamWriter sw, Type type) - This method is used to write the end marker of the object or the property being serialized.


It looks like the class is using a StreamWriter to output the serialized data and it's also using reflection to get the properties and fields of the objects that are being serialized.
